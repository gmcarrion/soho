<p>##INTRODUCTION</p>
<pre><code>Cell polarity is an important feature of cell development in metazoans.  Molecular cell polarity refers to the asymmetrical distribution of proteins and other cellular components within the cell and contributes to normal cell division.  Polarity is established at the one-cell stage and leads to asymmetrical cell divisions and the differentiation of cell fates (Lang, C.F., et al, 2017).  
PAR proteins are a group of highly conserved proteins found in metazoans that regulate cell polarity.  PAR proteins are typically asymmetrically localized in cells and can either be mutually supportive or mutually antagonistic.  Before zygote polarization, anterior PAR proteins are found in the cell cortex while posterior PAR proteins are found in the cytoplasm.  After two distinct phases of zygote polarization, establishment and maintenance, PAR proteins localize to opposite ends of the cell (Ramanujam, R., et al, 2018).  
Two important kinases involved in cell polarization are PAR-1 and Atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) which are mutually antagonistic.  After symmetry breaking occurs in the zygote, PAR-1 becomes localized in the posterior portion of the cell while aPKC becomes localized in the anterior portion of the cell.  Localization of these kinases aids in the asymmetrical division of the zygote into a larger anterior cell, that ultimately differentiates into the epidermis and neurons, and a smaller posterior cell, that ultimately differentiates into intestines, muscles, and germline cells (Personal communication with Dickinson Lab, UT Austin).  However, not much is known about the genes and the molecular mechanisms that control the localization of these kinases.
The genes, Lin-5 and CDC-42, are putative genes involved in defining early cell polarity.  Lin-5 is involved in positioning the mitotic spindle and embryos that lack Lin-5 function fail to properly align their chromosomes and undergo cytokinesis (Lorson, M.A., et al, 2000).  CDC-42 has been shown to associate with PAR-6 and aPKC and recruit this complex to the anterior portion of the cell (Etienne-Manneville, S. et al, 2001).
To determine if the genes, Lin-5 and CDC-42, are involved in defining early cell polarity in C. elegans embryos, we introduced RNAi constructs that knocked down the expression of these genes.  We then observed the shape, orientation, and concentration of PAR-2::GFP in two-cell and four-cell stage C. elegans embryos.  We found that the two-cell and four-cell stage Lin-5 and CDC-42 knockdown embryos divided symmetrically and that PAR-2::GFP was either absent from the cells or concentrated in an atypical location within the cells.</code></pre>
<p>##METHODS</p>
<p>#Worms
Two C. elegans strains were used in this study. The first strain, UTX13, expressed PAR-2::GFP and PAR-6::RFP while another strain, UTX3, expressed only PAR-6::RFP. Both strains were grown on NGM (Nematode Growth Medium) at 20 °C on culture plates with the E. coli strain, OP50. The UTX13 strain was used for imaging the C. elegans embryos while UTX3 was used in viability studies.</p>
<p>#RNAi<br />
The HT115 strain of E. coli contained a transgenic RNAi “empty vector” control or an RNAi vector that targeted the Lin-5 and CDC-42 genes. RNAi experiments were performed by feeding HT115 E. coli to C. elegans at the L3/L4 stage. Media culture plates for the RNAi knockdown experiments contained NGM, IPTG which induced expression of RNAi constructs, and Carbenicillin that acted as a selective agent for the HT115 strain of E. coli. C. elegans were allowed to lay eggs on the RNAi plates for 2 hours and the eggs remained on the RNAi plate for 48 hours.</p>
